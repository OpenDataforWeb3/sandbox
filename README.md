# Sandbox
This repository collects efforts by the OpenData Community to support and even lead open source projects that support our mission.

We are in the process of defining our v 1.0 of this support.  You can join that discussion and help out by joining the #sandbox channel on our Discord.

Likely areas of support may include:
- A home for useful projects
   - if needed, sub repositories here or elsewhere
   - dedicated Discord channel
   - web site listings
- Ongoing promotion 
   - Twitter spaces 
- Technical reviews
   - This due dilligence can be useful 
   - Due dilligence will also be used to determine which projects to highlight
- Featured inclusion in the Landscape
- Featured inclusion in our data stack
- Hackathon focus
   - Sandbox projects that have been reviewed may be featured in hackathons
- Ongoing hackathon - aka bounties

Future directions may include:
- Grants program
- Aqueduct
- Governance or metagovernance assistance
- Smart contract audits
- Other launch assistance

We are extremely proud of all alumnni hackathon contestants.  Many alumnni are collaborating on the Sandbox and other projects now.

Regarding Sandbox requirements, projects should:
- have a stated open source license
    - at this time we think either GPT3 or Apache2 are preferable
- be able to concisely communicate their value and status
    - why does the project exist
    - what are the immediate development and other priorities
    - how can the ODC help?  

Please join us!
