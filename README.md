# Sandbox

This repository collects projects that have followed our pipeline and have been sponsored by the community, they are open source and support our mission. 

The Sandbox pipeline have been designed by the community and can be found [here on our forum](https://forum.opendatacommunity.org/t/project-pipeline-in-detail/28/5).

To create your project please start through the sandbox teams [repo](https://github.com/orgs/OpenDataforWeb3-sandbox/repositories) and follow the pipeline, as your project matures and fulfills the process requirements it will be displayed here.
