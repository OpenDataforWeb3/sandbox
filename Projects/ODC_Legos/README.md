Hi! Here is where you can find documentation and contribute to the ODC Legos Package project. 

## Project History   

The ODC Legos was born from the needs of Gitcoin FDD team ( link )  and OpenData Community ( link) efforts to develop a solution for these needs .  It has been the theme of a bounty on the second ODC hackathon where participants had to develop and pack sybil detection algorithms into standardized solutions in a way that legos could be combined and enhance the identification of fraud in rounds of public funding distribution. 
From the hackathon, a different number of solutions had emerged, some of  them packaging legos on python packages, others implementing it natively on dashboards.
ODC launched the Sandbox initiative and decided to invest in this project as one of the tools that has immediate impact and usage inside the fraud prevention space on web3.

## What  value does it deliver? 

The project aims to be a tool for other ODC projects that validates and screens funding round information but not only that, it aims to be a tool for Data Analyst and Data Scientist that perform risk and fraud analysis all around the web3 ecosystem. 
It delivers fast, simple or complex validations of behavior of wallets and grants applications. It is designed in modules  so it could be combined to suit the users' need giving it context.
